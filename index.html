            <strong>Entrepreneur, Traveler, Father, Surfer, and Language Learner:</strong>
            In June of 2019 after a long career in mortgage and non-profit housing development, my wife and 8-year-old
            son and I decided to take a year off and travel the world. I had previously started a small “Healthy
            Vending” company as “side gig” and
            together with renting our home on Airbnb, teaching English to Chinese children online, and a small amount of savings
            as a backup, we hoped to come close to breaking even financially each month and maybe even become able to fund
            our travels indefinitely.
            <br>
            While we were living in our first stop in Cuenca, Ecuador we came across many full-time travelers that
            “code” and work remotely. At their suggestion, I began to investigate a few languages like JavaScript, HTML, and
            CSS found that the learing process was very similar to I had been doing to
            prepare for our travels. I also loved the challenge and the process of coding, but soon found that I needed a bit
            more structure in order to really wrap my arms around the process and this is where UCF Coding Bootcamp came in. I love 
            work and I am looking forward to seeing where it takes me while exploring the world.
